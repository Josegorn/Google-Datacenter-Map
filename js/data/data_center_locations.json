Since furniture mills used a lot of power, we were able to reuse much of the existing power infrastructure. Lenoir is now home to the Internet, but also to our data center employees. Because of this, we've awarded more than $350,000 in grants and provided over $2M in free advertising to local nonprofits. We've also invested in several green initiatives, including a project to turn hog waste into renewable energy.",

The Ring is so called for its extremely high seismic activity and number of volcanoes.  It encompasses 75% of the world's active and dormant volcanoes and is responsible for approximately 90% of the world’s earthquakes (Bioexpedition, n.d.).  In 2010, Chile was struck by a massive 8.8 MW earthquake.  At the time it was the 5th largest earthquake ever recorded and actually altered the Earth changed the speed of the Earth’s rotation (Than, 2010).  Events like this are cause for concern for Google and might limit the amount it invests in the future as they jeopardize their investments in the country.  They might be more willing to invest more heavily in their other data centers, such as Hamina, where natural disasters rarely occur.",
                "government": "Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations (BBC, 2012).  On the international stage, Chile is also very active.  It was also one of the founding members of the United Nations, it is a member of the UN Human Rights Council and is currently one of the five non-permanent members on the UN Security Council (United Nations, n.d.).  These factors are important for multinational companies like Google when they are considering investing their resources in a country as it shows that Chile has a stable, functioning government and there is a low risk to their investments from a political point of view.",

In 2010 it became the first South American country to join The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an organisation whose purpose is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world (OECD, 2010).  Chile's policies towards foreign investment are simple and transparent.  This makes it straightforward for foreign investors, such as Google, to conduct their business with little restriction, and it allows them to access Chile's official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.",

Located near an industrial water canal, the facility is water self-sufficient as it draws water from the canal in to its 20,000 sq. ft. water treatment plant.  The water is filtered and treated just enough that it can be used to cool the servers in the data center which is collocated to the water treatment plant. Belgium's climate is cool enough that Google does not need to chill the water before using it which drastically reduces its energy consumption needs (Verge, Google Invests $390 Million to Expand Belgium Facility, 2013).  The St-Ghislain data center is one of two Google data centers that is \"chiller-less\", the other being in Finland.

Dublin has also attracted other tech giants in setting up shop in the country including Microsoft, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, HP and Dropbox (McDonald, 2012).",
                "climate": "Like its other data centers in the European region, Dublin was chosen for its cool temperatures.  While it isn't completely chiller-less like its brethren in Belgium and Finland, it does make extensive use of the cool sea air blowing in off the coast to chill its servers allowing it to reduce cooling costs.",
                "government": "In 2009, Ireland was one of the hardest hit countries of the global recession.  However even at that time, an American independent technology research company Forrester Research, urged US companies to establish themselves in Dublin because besides its cool climate, Ireland also has a young, highly-educated workforce and a very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent (Irish Central, 2014). This is half the global average and almost a third of the North American average (KPMG, n.d.).

Compared to its data centers in the Asia-Pacific region, where locations are chosen based on the hosts country's political climate and network infrastructure, Finland was chosen for its cool climate and geographic stability.  One of the unique features of the Hamina site is that raw sea water is piped through one of the paper mill's existing tunnels to cool all of the servers in the data center naturally (Google Inc., n.d.).  The water is cold enough that Google does not need to cool the water before using it allowing it to drastically reduce its energy consumption needs.  The Hamina data center is one of two Google data centers that is \"chiller-less\", the other being in Belgium.",
                "climate": "Finland is cold. In July, it averages 13 - 17 degrees Celsius (WeatherOnline, n.d.). From an energy consumption standpoint, this makes it an ideal location to run a datacenter and keep its thousands of servers from overheating without having to spend a fortune on cooling costs.  (For Google, this can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars). As it's in the Arctic Circle, Finland has a cold, temperate climate that is almost subarctic but at the same time, comparatively mild due to the moderating influence of the North Atlantic Current, Baltic Sea, and it’s more than 60,000 lakes (CIA Factbook, n.d.).  In other words, it's cold but not too cold.  In addition, in the past 30 years, Finland has very rarely suffered any natural disasters and has a very low risk of earthquakes, making it an ideal location to invest $340 million to build a data center (Prevention Web, n.d.).",
                "energy": "The Hamina data center is one of the most energy efficient data centers in the world.  One of Google's priorities when building its data centers has been to minimize, as much as possible, its carbon footprint.  To that end, in January 2014, Google announced that it had signed a deal to buy the entire electricity output of a new wind farm being built  in neighbouring Sweden to power its Finnish data center (Verge, 2014). This was in addition to its 2013 announcement that it had signed a similar deal to buy the entire ten-year output of a separate Swedish wind farm in order to offset the carbon costs of running its Hamina data center (Verge, Google Powering Finnish Server Farm with Swedish Wind Farm, 2013). The move helped cement Google's green energy claims while at the same time protecting it from fluctuating energy prices.",

It was chosen because of its reputation as a high-tech hub, strong support of foreign investment, and its location right in the heart of Asia.  One of the unique features of this facility is its use of a nighttime cooling and thermal energy storage system.  It works by cooling the water stored in its storage tanks at night when the air is cooler, and then uses that cool water during the day to cool its servers when the temperatures are hotter (Google, n.d.).  From the heat map you can see that Google receives a lot of traffic from Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Taiwan was chosen over these other countries (except Singapore) for a variety of reasons.",
                "government": "The government of Taiwan is very to open foreign investment and does not impose strict restrictions on transnational companies that wishing to set up shop within its borders.  They also do not attempt to censor or filter any of Google's services or traffic as is the case with China which sits on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, a mere 180km away.  China plays a large role in determining where Google places its datacenters in the Asia-Pacific region due to its large population and the traffic they generate.  When Google was first planning its expansion into the region it had planned to build a datacenter in Hong Kong along with the ones in Taiwan and Singapore however that plan was later cancelled (Kim, 2013).  The relationship between the US based Google and China has gone through many ups and downs due to China's tight grip on the flow information within the country and often blocks or restricts access to Google's services (Google, n.d.).  Having a much more open government to work with, while still being close to the large amount of users in China, allows Google to keep its services running in the region as smoothly as possible.",
                "economy": "Although Taiwan's population ranks 52nd in the world in size, its economy ranks 21st thanks to its high tech industry (CIA, n.d.).  It is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and is a member of the WTO and APEC.  In addition, the regulatory environment of Taiwan is very stable and accommodating which means Google doesn't have to worry about new laws coming into effect that could, in effect, jeopardize its operations and investments in the country.  The cost of living in Taiwan is also low which perhaps also played a factor in Google choosing Taiwan over other countries such as Japan where the cost of living and the cost of land is much higher.  This is an important factor as it lowers the cost of operating the data center.",

                "network": "Singapore would not be the global commercial hub today if it wasn't one of the world’s most well-connected countries.  The South-East Asia Japan Cable (SJC) is an undersea fiber optic cable that is jointly owned by Google that connects 7 countries in South East Asia (Lee, 2013). It provides 28 Tbps (Terabits per second) of bandwidth and its landing point in Singapore is only a few blocks away from Google's data center.  The SJC cable is just 1 of 28 undersea fiber optic cables that come into Singapore and provide it with lightning fast network communications connecting it to other major cities around the world. By comparison, Canada has 6 undersea cables connecting it to other countries (TeleGeography, 2014). <br /> One of the other landing points of the SJC cable is Chikura Japan, which from the map, you can see is the landing point of 2 other Google-owned undersea fiber optic cables, Unity and FASTER (Chowdhry, 2014).  The FASTER cable will be a 60 Tbps fiber cable connecting the US West coast to Japan in 2016.  On the US side, one of FASTER's landing points is Bandon, Oregon, the same state that houses Google's The Dalles datacenter.  The Unity cable is a 3.3 Tbps fiber cable that also connects Japan to the US West coast, this one landing in Redondo Beach, California.  It is worth noting that Google's worldwide headquarters is located on the US west coast in Mountain View, California, just outside San Francisco.",
