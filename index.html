    Overview

    <hr>
    <h3 id="in-the-beginning-">In the beginning...</h3>

    <p>Since its humble beginnings in a friend’s garage in 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have transformed Google into
        a multi-billion dollar technology juggernaut with 84 offices in 47 countries spanning 6 continents (the only one
        without an office being Antarctica...for now).</p>

    <h3 id="products">Products</h3>

    <p>Due to its rapid growth, Google has expanded its portfolio beyond its core search engine service to include
        online productivity software including email (Gmail), a cloud storage service (Google Drive), an office suite
        (Google Docs), a social networking service (Google+) and an online video streaming service (YouTube). In
        addition it is also behind the world’s most popular mobile operating system (Android) and in recent years has
        started making its way into the hardware business with its Chromebook line of laptops, Nexus line of smartphones
        and Google Fiber internet service.</p>

    <h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>

    <p> Here are some numbers, to put the size of Google&#39;s operations into perspective.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>40,000</strong> - Average number of Google Searches per second. This amounts to <strong>3.5
            billion</strong> searches per day and <strong>1.2 trillion</strong> searches per year (Google Search
            Statistics, n.d.).
        </li>
        <li><strong>6 billion</strong> - The hours of video that are watched each month on YouTube (Statistics, n.d.).
        </li>
        <li><strong>20 petabytes</strong> - The amount of information processed by Google&#39;s servers in one day (1
            petabyte = 1,000,000 gigabytes) (Gunelius, 2013).
        </li>
        <li><strong>$59.825 billion</strong> - Google&#39;s Total Revenue in 2013 (United States Securities And Exchange
            Commission, 2013). If it were a country it would rank 74 out of 192 countries in terms of 2013 GDP (World
            DataBank, 2013).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google&#39;s success, can in large part, be attributed to its speed and ability to scale its operations. While
        official numbers have never been released, it is estimated that Google has at least 900,000 servers to run all
        it services (Miller, 2009). The bulk of these servers are housed in datacenters Google has built in strategic
        locations around the world to handle all the traffic it receives and keep their services running
        uninterrupted.</p>

    <h3 id="why-">Why?</h3>

    <p>Datacenters are expensive. They are expensive to build and they are expensive to operate. It was reported that
        Google spent $7.3 billion in 2013 on datacenters alone (Miller, Google Spent $7.3 Billion on its Data Centers in
        2013, 2014).
        So why build them in the first place? Because they allow Google to have complete control over all aspects of the
        information they process and store. With Google expanding its datacenter locations around the world and funding
        the undersea fiber optic cables that connect them, Google has control over almost every point in your data&#39;s
        journey around the world. This is important to Google as it can guarantee the security and speed of the data at
        it travels across the world’s networks. The location of these datacenters is chosen very carefully as a number
        of very important factors must be present for a site to be considered suitable.</p>
    <h4 id="factors">Factors</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p><em>Availability of large amounts of cheap electricity</em></p>

            <p> Datacenters require massive amounts of power to run and cool all their servers. Google considers the
                exact amount of power one of their datacenters uses to be a trade secret, but in 2010 they revealed that
                altogether they consume 260 MW of power (Glanz, 2011). That’s 260 million watts. That’s more power than
                the city of Salt Lake City uses (Chan, 2011).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Google’s commitment to carbon neutrality</em></p>

            <p> Because of the amounts of power required to run a datacenter, Google has become a big supporter of using
                renewable energy. So far, Google uses renewable energy to power over 35% of its operations and is
                actively involved in growing the industry with over $1.5 billion in funding agreements committed towards
                renewable energy projects (Google Inc., n.d.).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Availability of a large water supply</em></p>

            <p> Servers produce heat. A lot of heat. And when you have thousands of them in one building, keeping them
                all cool can become very costly. Because of this, Google has situated many of its datacenters near large
                bodies of water and uses them as massive thermal reservoirs.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Large chunks of land</em></p>

            <p> For security reasons, it is important for Google to build its datacenters on large parcels of land. This
                allows for a large buffer zone between nearby roads and the datacenter and makes the facility easier to
                secure. In addition, the extra land real estate can also be used to install wind farms or solar panels
                to act as supplemental power to the datacenter.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Fast connections to other data centers</em></p>

            <p> The advantages to having a powerful datacenter are rendered moot if the connections in and out of it are
                slow. Because of this, Google chooses sites based on their proximity to other Google datacenters as well
                as their proximity to large backbone networks that can transmit their data quickly over very large
                distances. Displayed on the map are the locations of the undersea fiber optic cables that Google has
                (publicly) funded. They are shown to add extra perspective in to their choice of datacenter locations.
                There are hundreds of these undersea cables in operation today that criss-cross the globe and Google
                uses many of them. Which ones they use exactly is not publicly known so they aren&#39;t shown on the
                map.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Others...</em></p>

            <p> Some other factors that play a role include a countries political climate, its regulatory institutions,
                and threat of natural disasters.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note that the US based data centers are not covered in this report.</em></p>

    Chile

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="quilicura-chile">Quilicura, Chile</h1>

    <p>Chile is the home of Google&#39;s first foray into Latin America. After the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America is
        the fastest growing region for new internet users in the world (European Travel Commission, n.d.). Many had
        expected Brazil to be Google&#39;s choice when it inevitably moved into the region however Chile won out over
        its larger sibling for a variety of reasons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><em>Government</em></p>

            <p>
                Chile is one of South America&#39;s most stable and prosperous nations (BBC,
                2012). On the international stage, Chile is also very active. It was also one of the founding members of
                the
                United Nations, it is a member of the UN Human Rights Council and is currently one of the five
                non-permanent
                members on the UN Security Council (United Nations, n.d.). These factors are important for multinational
                companies like Google when they are considering investing their resources in a country as it shows that
                Chile has a stable, functioning government and there is a low risk to their investments from a political
                point of view.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Economy</em>

            <p>

            <p>
                Chile has the highest degree of economic freedom in South America and ranks 7th
                worldwide (By comparison, Canada is 6th) (The Heritage Foundation, n.d.). In 2010 it became the first
                South
                American country to join The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an
                organisation
                whose purpose is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people
                around
                the world (OECD, 2010). Chile&#39;s policies towards foreign investment are simple and transparent. This
                makes it straightforward for foreign investors, such as Google, to conduct their business with little
                restriction, and it allows them to access Chile&#39;s official foreign exchange market to repatriate
                their
                profits and capital.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Geography</em></p>

            <p>Chile sits in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a series of oceanic trenches, 40,000
                km long that forms a horse-shoe shape around the Pacific Ocean from Chile to Alaska, across to Russia,
                and
                down to Australia. The Ring is so called for its extremely high seismic activity and number of
                volcanoes. It
                encompasses 75% of the world&#39;s active and dormant volcanoes and is responsible for approximately 90%
                of
                the world’s earthquakes (Bioexpedition, n.d.). In 2010, Chile was struck by a massive 8.8 MW earthquake.
                At
                the time it was the 5th largest earthquake ever recorded and actually altered the Earth changed the
                speed of
                the Earth’s rotation (Than, 2010). Events like this are cause for concern for Google and might limit the
                amount it invests in the future as they jeopardize their investments in the country. They might be more
                willing to invest more heavily in their other data centers, such as Hamina, where natural disasters
                rarely
                occur.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!--========================================================================================================

    Finland

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="hamina-finland">Hamina, Finland</h1>

    <p>Google&#39;s data center in Finland was built inside an old paper mill situated just outside the small town of
        Hamina, on the coast of the Baltic Sea (Google Inc., n.d.). Compared to its data centers in the Asia-Pacific
        region, where locations are chosen based on the hosts country&#39;s political climate and network
        infrastructure, Finland was chosen for its cool climate and geographic stability. One of the unique features of
        the Hamina site is that raw sea water is piped through one of the paper mill&#39;s existing tunnels to cool all
        of the servers in the data center naturally (Google Inc., n.d.). The water is cold enough that Google does not
        need to cool the water before using it allowing it to drastically reduce its energy consumption needs. The
        Hamina data center is one of two Google data centers that is &quot;chiller-less&quot;, the other being in
        Belgium.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><em>Climate</em></p>

            <p>Finland is cold. In July, it averages 13 - 17 degrees Celsius (WeatherOnline,
                n.d.). From an energy consumption standpoint, this makes it an ideal location to run a datacenter and
                keep
                its thousands of servers from overheating without having to spend a fortune on cooling costs. (For
                Google,
                this can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars). As it&#39;s in the Arctic Circle, Finland has a
                cold,
                temperate climate that is almost subarctic but at the same time, comparatively mild due to the
                moderating
                influence of the North Atlantic Current, Baltic Sea, and it’s more than 60,000 lakes (CIA Factbook,
                n.d.).
                In other words, it&#39;s cold but not too cold. In addition, in the past 30 years, Finland has very
                rarely
                suffered any natural disasters and has a very low risk of earthquakes, making it an ideal location to
                invest
                $340 million to build a data center (Prevention Web, n.d.).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Energy</em></p>

            <p>The Hamina data center is one of the most energy efficient data centers in the
                world. One of Google&#39;s priorities when building its data centers has been to minimize, as much as
                possible, its carbon footprint. To that end, in January 2014, Google announced that it had signed a deal
                to
                buy the entire electricity output of a new wind farm being built in neighbouring Sweden to power its
                Finnish
                data center (Verge, 2014). This was in addition to its 2013 announcement that it had signed a similar
                deal
                to buy the entire ten-year output of a separate Swedish wind farm in order to offset the carbon costs of
                running its Hamina data center (Verge, Google Powering Finnish Server Farm with Swedish Wind Farm,
                2013).
                The move helped cement Google&#39;s green energy claims while at the same time protecting it from
                fluctuating energy prices.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!--========================================================================================================

    Belgium

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="st-ghislain-belgium">St. Ghislain, Belgium</h1>

    <p>Belgium is the home of Google&#39;s first European data center (Google Inc., n.d.). Like Finland, Google chose to
        build a datacenter in Belgium because of its cool climate and developable land. Located near an industrial water
        canal, the facility is water self-sufficient as it draws water from the canal in to its 20,000 sq. ft. water
        treatment plant. The water is filtered and treated just enough that it can be used to cool the servers in the
        data center which is collocated to the water treatment plant. Belgium&#39;s climate is cool enough that Google
        does not need to chill the water before using it which drastically reduces its energy consumption needs (Verge,
        Google Invests $390 Million to Expand Belgium Facility, 2013). The St-Ghislain data center is one of two Google
        data centers that is &quot;chiller-less&quot;, the other being in Finland. It is considered water
        self-sufficient as it only uses 100% recycled water and not potable (or drinking) water for its cooling needs
        (Google, 2009).</p>

    <!--========================================================================================================

    Netherlands

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="eemshaven-netherlands">Eemshaven, Netherlands</h1>

    <p>In the Netherlands, Google recently announced it had broken ground a new datacenter in the industrial sector of
        Eemshaven on the coast of the North Sea. It expects the facility to be fully operational by the end of 2017.
        From the first day it becomes operational, Google plans to power the facility using 100% renewable energy from a
        nearby windfarm currently being built in nearby Delfzijl. Google has bought the entire 10 year output of this
        windfarm to power its data center. Eemshaven is also the landing point of an undersea fiber optic cable that
        connects Europe to the US which Google will certainly make use of.</p>

    <!--========================================================================================================

    Dublin

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="dublin-ireland">Dublin, Ireland</h1>

    <p>Google has built up a large presence in Dublin, Ireland. It is the home of its European Headquarters, as well as
        two data centers. The first data center opened in September 2012 with the second one currently under
        construction (Verge, Dublin Officials Green-light Google Data Center, 2014). Dublin has also attracted other
        tech giants in setting up shop in the country including Microsoft, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, HP and Dropbox
        (McDonald, 2012).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><em>Climate</em></p>

            <p>Like its other data centers in the European region, Dublin was chosen for its
                cool temperatures. While it isn&#39;t completely chiller-less like its brethren in Belgium and Finland,
                it
                does make extensive use of the cool sea air blowing in off the coast to chill its servers allowing it to
                reduce cooling costs.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Governement</em></p>

            <p>In 2009, Ireland was one of the hardest hit countries of the global
                recession. However even at that time, an American independent technology research company Forrester
                Research, urged US companies to establish themselves in Dublin because besides its cool climate, Ireland
                also has a young, highly-educated workforce and a very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent (Irish
                Central, 2014). This is half the global average and almost a third of the North American average (KPMG,
                n.d.). This makes it very cheap for Google to do business and is why Dublin has attracted other high
                profile
                tech companies to the area.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!--========================================================================================================

    Taiwan

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="changhua-county-taiwan">Changhua County, Taiwan</h1>

    <p>Changhua County is the home of Google&#39;s largest datacenter in the Asia-Pacific region (Yu-Tzu, 2013). It was
        chosen because of its reputation as a high-tech hub, strong support of foreign investment, and its location
        right in the heart of Asia. One of the unique features of this facility is its use of a nighttime cooling and
        thermal energy storage system. It works by cooling the water stored in its storage tanks at night when the air
        is cooler, and then uses that cool water during the day to cool its servers when the temperatures are hotter
        (Google, n.d.). From the heat map you can see that Google receives a lot of traffic from Japan, China, South
        Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Taiwan was chosen over these other countries (except Singapore) for a
        variety of reasons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><em>Government</em></p>

            <p>The government of Taiwan is very to open foreign investment and does not
                impose strict restrictions on transnational companies that wishing to set up shop within its borders.
                They
                also do not attempt to censor or filter any of Google&#39;s services or traffic as is the case with
                China
                which sits on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, a mere 180km away. China plays a large role in
                determining where Google places its datacenters in the Asia-Pacific region due to its large population
                and
                the traffic they generate. When Google was first planning its expansion into the region it had planned
                to
                build a datacenter in Hong Kong along with the ones in Taiwan and Singapore however that plan was later
                cancelled (Kim, 2013). The relationship between the US based Google and China has gone through many ups
                and
                downs due to China&#39;s tight grip on the flow information within the country and often blocks or
                restricts
                access to Google&#39;s services (Google, n.d.). Having a much more open government to work with, while
                still
                being close to the large amount of users in China, allows Google to keep its services running in the
                region
                as smoothly as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Economy</em></p>

            <p>Although Taiwan&#39;s population ranks 52nd in the world in size, its economy
                ranks 21st thanks to its high tech industry (CIA, n.d.). It is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and is a
                member
                of the WTO and APEC. In addition, the regulatory environment of Taiwan is very stable and accommodating
                which means Google doesn&#39;t have to worry about new laws coming into effect that could, in effect,
                jeopardize its operations and investments in the country. The cost of living in Taiwan is also low which
                perhaps also played a factor in Google choosing Taiwan over other countries such as Japan where the cost
                of
                living and the cost of land is much higher. This is an important factor as it lowers the cost of
                operating
                the data center.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    Singapore

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="singapore">Singapore</h1>

    <p>Although it is a small island on the southern tip of Malaysia, Singapore is one of the world’s major commercial
        hubs boasting the world’s fourth-largest financial centre which houses some of the world’s largest banks,
        businesses and stock exchanges (Mark Yeandle, 2014). It is also a huge shipping and logistics hub with the 2nd
        busiest container port in the world (World Shipping Council, 2014) Singapore is a highly modern city-state
        located in one of the fastest-growing market for Internet users in the world. Its advanced infrastructure and
        economy make it an ideal location for Google to build a data center.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><em>Network</em></p>

            <p>Singapore would not be the global commercial hub today if it wasn&#39;t one of the
                world’s most well-connected countries. The South-East Asia Japan Cable (SJC) is an undersea fiber optic
                cable that is jointly owned by Google that connects 7 countries in South East Asia (Lee, 2013). It
                provides
                28 Tbps (Terabits per second) of bandwidth and its landing point in Singapore is only a few blocks away
                from
                Google&#39;s data center. The SJC cable is just 1 of 28 undersea fiber optic cables that come into
                Singapore
                and provide it with lightning fast network communications connecting it to other major cities around the
                world. By comparison, Canada has 6 undersea cables connecting it to other countries (TeleGeography,
                2014).
                One of the other landing points of the SJC cable is Chikura Japan, which from the map, you can see is
                the
                landing point of 2 other Google-owned undersea fiber optic cables, Unity and FASTER (Chowdhry, 2014).
                The
                FASTER cable will be a 60 Tbps fiber cable connecting the US West coast to Japan in 2016. On the US
                side,
                one of FASTER&#39;s landing points is Bandon, Oregon, the same state that houses Google&#39;s The Dalles
                datacenter. The Unity cable is a 3.3 Tbps fiber cable that also connects Japan to the US West coast,
                this
                one landing in Redondo Beach, California. It is worth noting that Google&#39;s worldwide headquarters is
                located on the US west coast in Mountain View, California, just outside San Francisco.

    Summary

    =========================================================================================================-->

    <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

    <p>Google does not take its decisions lightly. As you can tell, there are a lot of factors that go in to deciding
        each location and the importance of each one varies by region. Everything from a countries political tendencies
        and economic policies to its geographic stability and climate are all weighed in an effort to make the most
        informed decision possible. Billions of dollars is spent by Google in every region of the world in order to
        allow its users fast, uninterrupted access to its services, most of which are offered for free. Altogether,
        Google is driving innovation and pushing the limits of the world’s network infrastructure and data centers.
        Hopefully this will give you pause for thought the next time you are watching a cat video on YouTube.</p>
