                        <p>Since its humble beginnings in a friends garage in 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have transformed Google into a multi-billion dollar technology juggernaut with 84 offices in 47 countries spanning 6 continents (the only one without an office being Antarctica...for now).</p>
                        <h3 id="products">Products</h3>
                        <p>Due to its rapid growth, Google has expanded its portfolio beyond its core search engine
                            service to include online productivity software including email (<a href="https://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>), a cloud storage service (<a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>), an office suite (<a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>), a social networking service (<a href="https://plus.google.com">Google+</a>) and an online video streaming service (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>).  In addition it is also behind
                            the worlds most popular mobile operating system (<a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a>) and in recent years has started making its way into the hardware business with its <a href="https://www.google.ca/chrome/devices/">Chromebook</a> line of laptops, <a href="https://www.google.ca/nexus/">Nexus</a> line of smartphones and <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about2/">Google Fiber</a> broadband service.</p>
                        <h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>
                        <p> Here are some numbers, to put the size of Google&#39;s operations into perspective.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>40,000</strong> - Average number of Google Searches per second. This amounts to <strong>3.5 billion</strong> searches per day and <strong>1.2 trillion</strong> searches per year.</li>
                            <li><strong>6 billion</strong> -  The hours of video that are watched each month on YouTube</li>
                            <li><strong>20 petabytes</strong> - The amount of information processed by Google&#39;s servers in one day (1 petabyte = 1,000,000 gigabytes)</li>
                            <li><strong>$59.825 billion</strong> - Google&#39;s Total Revenue in 2013.  If it were a country it would rank 74 out of 192 countries in terms of 2013 GDP.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="scale">Scale</h3>
                        <p>Google&#39;s success, can in large part, be attributed to its speed and ability to scale its operations.  While official numbers have never been released, it is estimated that Google has at least 900,000 servers to run all it services.  The bulk of these servers are housed in data centers Google has built in strategic locations around the world to handle all the traffic it receives and keep their operations running uninterrupted.  The location of these datacenters is chosen very carefully as a number of very important factors must be present for a site to be considered suitable.</p>
                        <h4 id="factors">Factors</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><em>Availability of large amounts of cheap electricity</em>  </p>
                                <p>  Data centers require massive amounts of power to run and cool all their servers.  Google considers the exact amount of power one of their data centers uses to be a trade secret, but it is estimated that just one of its datacenters needs anywhere from 50 - 100 Megawatts of power.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><em>Googleâ€™s commitment to carbon neutrality</em>  </p>
                                <p>  Because of the amounts of power required to run a datacenter, Google has become a big supporter of using renewable energy.  So far Google is using renewable energy to power over 35% of their operations and is actively involved in growing the renewables industry with over $1.5 billion in funding agreements for renewable energy projects.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><em>Availability of a large water supply</em>  </p>
                                <p>  Servers produce heat. A lot of heat. And when you have thousands of them in one building, cooling all them can become very costly.  Because of this, Google has situated many of its datacenters near large bodies of water and use them as massive thermal reservoirs.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><em>Large chunks of land</em>  </p>
                                <p>  For security reasons, it is important for Google to build its data centers on large parcels of land.  This allows for a large buffer zone between nearby roads and the datacenter and makes the facilty easier to secure.  In addition, the exra land real estate can also be used to install wind farms or solar panels to act as supplemental power to the datacenter.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><em>Fast connections to other data centers</em>  </p>
                                <p>  The advantages to having a powerful datacenter are rendered moot if the connections in and out of it are slow.  Because of this, Google chooses sites based on their proximity to other Google data centers as well as their proximity to large backbone networks that can transmit their data quickly over very large distances.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><em>Tax incentives</em>  </p>
                                <p>  Building a state-of-the-art datacenter is expensive.  At the same time however, they generate a lot of tax revenue and create a lot of jobs for the city (and state) they are built in.  Because of this, there is often competition between cities to attract Google to build their facilities.  This will often result in massive tax incentives for Google to offset the cost of building the datacenter.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some other factors that play a role include, political climate and threat of natural disasters.  These will be discussed in more detail when discussing certain datacenters.</p>
